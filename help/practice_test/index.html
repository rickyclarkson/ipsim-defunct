		<h1>Taking a practice test</h1>

		<p>
			You can prepare for the assessment by taking practice
			tests.  These are not recorded on University servers,
			you can do them as many times as you like.
		</p>

		<p>
			From working with IPSim at the same time as writing
			it, I have found that the more I practice, the easier
			it becomes, and the more consistency I use in
			numbering IP addresses, the easier it is, as in a
			real network.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you start IPSim, or go to File-&gt;New, you can
			select Practice Test from the radio buttons.
		</p>
		
		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			IPSim will then prompt you to choose a difficulty
			level.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				The difficulty of the real assessment will be
				roughly equivalent to a HARD practice test.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			The details of the randomly generated problem will
			now appear in the status bar at the bottom of the
			screen.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now you set about solving the problem.  In addition
			to the usual connectivity test you can use the
			Check Solution button on the toolbar, which will
			tell you how well connected the network is, and how well it
			<b>conforms</b> to our specifications, with feedback available as to
			what is currently wrong with the network.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you have 100% for your overall score, you can
			try another problem, perhaps Medium or even Hard.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are daunted by a Hard problem, remember that
			you can do the binary arithmetic on paper or using
			Windows Calculator in Scientific mode.  Just as a real
			system administrator would make notes, so can you.
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, IPSim does provide a limited notemaking facility,
			which is in the Tools menu, and be warned, again, that this
			scrapbook does not save the data to	file when you save or upload your network.
		</p>
				
		<p>
			When you are confident with all three difficulty
			levels, you are ready to take the assessment.  Be sure
			to keep practicing, in case you forget some details,
			and read the section in the online documentation about taking
			the real assessment, so that you are not surprised by
			any details when you take it.
