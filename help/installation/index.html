			Installing and running IPSim, and working with a simple
			network.
		</h1>
		
		<h2>Installing Java</h2>
		
		<p>
			If you are running IPSim on one of the machines in
			the CSE labs, you can
			move on to the next section, as Java is already
			installed.  Also, if you have already installed Java on
			your machine, you can move on to the next section.
		</p>

		<p>
					If you are unsure as to whether
					you have installed Java, go to Start-&gt;Run, then type 'cmd' in the box that appears.
		</p>
		<p>
					<img src="startrun.PNG" alt="Start-&gt;Run">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<img src="typecmd.png" alt="'cmd'">
		</p>
				
		<p>
			In the window that appears, type this, exactly: java -version
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You should see something like the following, and the version number should be at
			least 1.5.
		</p>
		
		<pre><code>
		C:\Documents and Settings\home&gt;java -version
		java version "1.5.0_07"
		Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_07-b03)
		Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_07-b03, mixed mode, sharing)</code></pre>
		
		<p>
			If you do this on Linux and see gij or kaffe, then you haven't got Java installed,
			but something similar to Java.  Find out how to install Sun Java on your system.
			The installation method varies slightly for each Linux distribution.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The installation instructions are on Sun Microsystems'
			website, but I have described them for Windows here.
			They may have changed since this writing, please
			tell us about this, by emailing <a href="mailto:devel@ipsim.com">devel@ipsim.com</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Windows Installation</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Open a web browser.</li>
			<li>Navigate to <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>.</li>
			<li>Click on the link "Java VM".</li>
			<li>Click on the image marked "Get It Now".</li>
			<li>A window should appear with the question
			"Do you want to install and run Java Plug-in X.X?".
			The version number may be 1.5, 1.6, 5.0, 6.0, etc.</li>
			<li>A window should appear with a licence agreement.
			When you have finished reading it, click
			"I accept the terms in the license agreement", then
			click Next to proceed.</li>
			<li>Click Typical (when asked whether you want a
			typical or custom installation), then click Next to
			proceed.</li>
			<li>Wait for the Java VM to install, then click Finish.
			</li>
			<li>Restart your system (this doesn't have to be done
			immediately.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Downloading/installing IPSim</h2>
		
		<p>
			Navigate to
			<a href="http://www.ipsim.com">www.ipsim.com</a>
			with a web
			browser and click on ipsim.jar.  It should open with Java.  If it opens with WinZIP
			instead or some other tool, save it, then right-click on it from Explorer to
			open with Java.  If you want to use it when you are offline then you will need to
			save it anyway.
		</p>

		<h2>Loading a Predefined Network</h2>
		
		<p>
			When you have launched IPSim, click on Ok in the initial dialog:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<img src="okDialog.png">
		</p>
			
		<p>	
			Click the "Download Configuration" icon.  When prompted, enter 'help0'.

			You should see a display like this:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<img src="help0.png" alt="help0 configuration">
		</p>
		
		<h2>Pinging a machine</h2>
		
		<p>
			Right-click on the computer on the left of the display,
			and select Ping from the menu that appears.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the box that appears, type 146.87.1.2, and click
			the Ping button.  You should see "Ping successful".
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<img
				src="ping_successful_1_2.png"
				alt="A successful ping"
			>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You just made the computer on the left 'ping' the
			computer in the centre of the display.  The computer on
			the left has the IP address 146.87.1.1.  You can
			verify this by right-clicking on the computer and
			selecting "List IP Addresses".
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The third computer from the left is a gateway, or router, as
			it has two network cards.  If you list its IP
			addresses, you will see two entries:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<img
				src="two_ip_addresses.png"
				alt="A list of two IP addresses"
			>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So, how can you tell which network card has each IP
			address?  The list of IP addresses includes card
			numbers.  If you hover your mouse over a card, you will
			see its card number, and you can match the two.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<img
				src="hover_card1.png"
				alt="Shows that card 1 is under the mouse"
			>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So, you can see that Card 1 is the card on the left,
			so the card on the left of the computer in the centre
			of the display has the IP address 146.87.1.2.  That is
			the address that we pinged earlier.  So we know that
			that part of the network is working.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now use the same techniques to discover the IP address
			of the right-hand network card on the computer in the
			centre, and the IP address of the network card on
			the computer on the far right of the display.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You should find that they are 146.87.2.1 and
			146.87.2.2 respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			From the computer with the IP address 146.87.2.2, ping
			the computer with the IP address 146.87.2.1.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<img
				src="ping_unsuccessful_2_1.png"
				alt="Host unreachable"
			>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The first thing to check is that everything is
			physically connected, which we can see at a first
			glance.  You can check to see which objects are
			connected to each other by dragging them around with
			the mouse.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So there are two likely faults.  One, or both, of the
			computers are configured incorrectly, or the hub has
			no power.  The easiest fault to look for is the power
			to the hub.  A powered-up hub has a green light on it.
			This one does not.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Right-click on the hub, and select "Toggle Power".  The green light should
			now appear.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now repeat the ping that you performed earlier.
		</p>
