			Creating and testing a very complex internet (five
			subnets)
		</h1>

		<p>
			You are the administrator of a research laboratory.
			There are 4 research teams, each of whom want their
			own separate subnet, so that research teams cannot
			accidentally hamper each others' progress.  However,
			they need to be linked to a central network which
			provides facilities such as printers, mail servers, and
			there are plans to link an Internet connection to this
			central network.
		</p>

		<p>
			To avoid any future conflict with IP addresses used on
			the real Internet, we will use the 10.0.0.0/8 network
			as our overall network number.  When the time comes to
			configure a real Internet connection, we will need to
			revise these numbers, but they shouldn't cause other
			problems when we do.
		</p>

		<p>
			You have been involved in several meetings to discuss
			the organisation, resulting in the physical layout
			below.
		</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Keeping within the 10.0.0.0/8 network, configure all
			the computers so that they can communicate with each
			other.
		</p>

		<p>
			As this is a complex task, you <b>will</b> probably
			make some mistakes, so test the network at each stage.
		</p>

		<p>
			Reading the numbers that the connectivity test gives
			you might be a little tricky (especially as there may
			be upwards of a hundred IP address combinations listed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Be prepared to use the Ping and Traceroute tools.  A
			typical strategy to get the whole network working might
			be as follows:
		</p>

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Ensure that, within each subnet, each
					computer can Ping each other computer.
					If they can't, check that
					<ul>
						<li>the hub has power</li>
						<li>
							the IP address and
							netmask are ok (for
							both the sender and
							the receiver)
						</li>
						<li>
							check the physical
							connections, by moving
							components around.
							If you move a hub and
							the cables attached to
							it don't move, then
							you probably didn't
							drag the cables close
							enough to the hub for
							them to be attached.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					Now ensure that at least one computer
					on a particular subnet can ping at
					least one computer (other than a
					gateway) on each other subnet.
				</li>

				<li>
					Now if you test the connectivity, you
					should only be left with a few pairs,
					usually just mistakes in routing
					tables, so you can go through and fix
					those one by one.
				</li>

				<li>
					As in reality, it helps to use a
					consistent numbering scheme, and where
					the problem allows, to use a simple
					subnet mask, such as /16 or /24.
					Administrators often draw diagrams of
					their networks, and write notes about
					them.  IPSim doesn't simulate this,
					because real computers don't show you
					their IP address at a glance.  You
					generally have to type ipconfig or
					ifconfig, depending on the platform, to
					see the IP address.  This doesn't stop
					you from making a separate diagram on
					paper, or taking a screenshot and
					annotating it in a word processor or
					paint program.
				</li>
				<li>
					IPSim has a
					scrapbook feature, accessible via the Tools menu, which might
					be useful for making some notes.  The scrapbook is not saved with your data,
					and is not uploaded to the server during an assessment.
				</li>
			</ul>
