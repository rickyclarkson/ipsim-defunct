		<h1>IPSim Help Contents</h1>

		<p>
			IPSim helps you to learn how to configure
			statically-subnetted IP-based computer networks, and assesses your skills.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You will practice solving a randomly generated problem, and it will score you on
			the network that you produce.  You will get feedback as to how well your network is
			set up (conformance) and how well it works as a connected network (connectivity).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In a real assessment, the way in which you used IPSim to solve your problem can
			also be assessed (by the assessor), as IPSim stores and uploads an event log.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In a real assessment, you will download a problem from a server, and upload it
			when you have solved the problem to the best of your ability.
