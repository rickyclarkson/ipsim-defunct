			Creating and testing a more complex Internet (three
			subnets).
		</h1>

		<p>
			Create an Internet as shown in the following diagram,
			install all Ethernet cards, enable packet forwarding
			on both gateways, and provide power to the hubs.
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Give the leftmost subnet IP addresses in the
			68.24.32.0/24 network, the middle subnet 68.24.30.0/24
			and the rightmost subnet 68.24.28.0/24.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Test the connectivity.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<img src="34_percent.png" alt="34% Connected">
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that the numbers in the last part of each IP
			address are likely to be different to the numbers
			above, because you were asked to pick your own.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Add a default route to the two leftmost computers,
			using the 68.24.32.0/24 IP address of the leftmost gateway.
		</p>

		<p>
			Make the two rightmost computers have a default route
			that says to route via the rightmost gateway.
		</p>

		<p>
			Test the connectivity.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="40_percent.png" alt="40% Connected">
		</p>

		<p>
			The actual percentage hasn't improved much.  The only
			improvement is that the two leftmost computers can now
			ping <b>both</b> IP addresses of the leftmost gateway,
			and the two rightmost computers can now ping
			<b>both</b> IP addresses of the rightmost gateway.
		</p>

		<p>
			When a computer on the left pings a computer in the
			middle, the packet gets to its destination, but the
			destination doesn't have a route configured to send
			packets back to the leftmost network.
		</p>

		<p>
			Add a default route from the leftmost gateway to the rightmost.  Also add
			default routes from the other computers on the middle subnet to the rightmost
			gateway.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now add an explicit route to the 68.24.32.0/24 network, from the rightmost
			gateway, routing via the leftmost gateway.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To do this, right-click on the rightmost gateway, select Add Explicit Route,
			then in the dialog that appears, enter a destination network of
			68.24.32.0, a destination subnet mask of 255.255.255.0,
			and in the gateway field, the 68.24.30.0/24 IP address
			of the leftmost gateway.  Click OK.
		</p>

		<p>
			Test the connectivity.
